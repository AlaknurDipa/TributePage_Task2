                She is a renowned and a devoted social worker who focuses on prioritizing the lives of orphaned children. Her decision to look after orphaned children was triggered by her own life experiences. During her childhood Sindhutai went through phases where she missed having someone by her side. In one of her interviews she said that it was at such times that she realized what it meant to be abandoned. Having suffered thus, she made it her lifeâ€™s mission to stand by needy and homeless children.
                Her greatness and kind nature is reflected in one of her speeches. She said, "I am with everyone who has no other people to look after them."

                    She was born on 14 November 1948 at Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district Maharashtra to Abhimanji Sathe, 
                    a cowherd by profession. Being an unwanted child, she was nicknamed 'Chindhi' (torn piece of cloth).
                    Her father was keen on educating Sindhutai, much against the wishes of her mother. 
                    Abhimanji used to send her to school under the pretext of cattle grazing, where she would use 'leaves of Bharadi Tree' 
                    as a slate as she could not afford a real slate because of financial reasons.
                    Abject poverty, responsibilities & an early marriage forced her to quit formal education after she passed 4th grade.
